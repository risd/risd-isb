			<p class="blue medium-small m25">An expanded gallery will facilitate a robust
				program of public lectures by visiting artists
				and illustrators, along with a full schedule of
				rotating exhibitions featuring work by students
				and faculty. A more open reception area and
				foyer will provide a central hub for interaction
				among students and faculty, who will have

				and departmental conference room will offer
				additional spaces for interaction and

			<p class="blue medium-small m25">The renovation will address the department’s
				urgent need for more home space — those
				all-important places where Illustration majors
				work on projects and establish some
				of the most valuable relationships of their
				professional lives. The second floor will also
				house a large painting studio, a small student

			<p class="blue medium-small m25">Like the floor below, this floor will be largely
				dedicated to providing home spaces for Illustration
				majors. At present, approximately
				90 home spaces are available for almost 300
				students, so the need to expand this type of
				creative space is great. The third floor will also
				offer storage space for safely housing large
				drawings and paintings in progress, along
				with a seminar room.

			<p class="blue medium-small m25">Five classrooms will offer clean surfaces, plenty
				of wall space and connectivity for student-owned
				laptops. With digital imaging integral to just
				about every course offered in Illustration, these
				spaces will be used to teach e-book design, animation,
				3D graphics, digital photography, gaming
				and other forms of digital illustration. A shared
				student workroom with a spray booth will allow
				for the production of larger works. In addition, a
				second small gallery and lounge will extend the
				visibility of student and professional work.

			<p class="blue medium-small m25">Two large painting studios will help meet the
				ongoing need for large, open studio space to accommodate
				the many courses requiring this type

				provide additional on-site storage for works in
				progress, which is especially important for sophomores,

			<p class="blue medium-small m25">Additional space in the building across the street
				will be renovated to meet the needs of
				Illustration majors. A new printmaking facility
				will provide an essential resource, as will a light-safe

				to the computer lab will foster exploration at the
				intersection of analogue and digital technologies.
